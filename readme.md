Dog Party static composition project #1
This was a very time consuming project for me but I'm really pleased with where I was able to end at. I completed the base project early and was able to go back and dry my code up. I was unable to 100% certain parts of the project, like my paragraphs are not responsive like i would like them to be. My two main goals for this project were to rewrite and dry up my html and css and to implement the JS.
